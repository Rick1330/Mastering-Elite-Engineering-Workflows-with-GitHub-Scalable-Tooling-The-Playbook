## Code of Conduct

Please adhere to our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) in all interactions.

## How to Contribute

### Reporting Bugs

If you find an issue or inaccuracy in the playbook, please open a bug report using our [bug report template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md).

### Suggesting Enhancements

For new ideas, improvements, or additional content, please open a feature request using our [feature request template](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md).

### Submitting Pull Requests

1.  **Fork the repository** and create a new branch from `main` (e.g., `feat/add-new-section` or `fix/typo-in-docs`).
2.  **Make your changes.** Ensure your contributions align with the existing style and content.
3.  **Test your changes locally.** If you're modifying documentation, build the MkDocs site to ensure proper rendering.
4.  **Commit your changes** using [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Examples:
    -   `docs: add new section on performance metrics`
    -   `fix: correct typo in code review section`
    -   `chore: update dependabot configuration`
5.  **Push your branch** to your forked repository.
6.  **Open a Pull Request** to the `main` branch of this repository. Fill out the [Pull Request template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) thoroughly.

## Review Process

All pull requests undergo a review process to ensure quality and consistency.

### Review Tiers

We employ a tiered review framework based on the impact and complexity of changes:

| Change Type      | Risk Level | Review Protocol | Reviewers Required | SLA        |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :-------------- | :----------------- | :--------- |
| Documentation    | Low        | Light review    | 1 reviewer         | 4 hours    |
| Test additions   | Low        | Standard review | 1 reviewer         | 8 hours    |
| Bug fixes        | Medium     | Standard review | 1-2 reviewers      | 8 hours    |
| New features     | High       | Thorough review | 2+ reviewers       | 24 hours   |
| Core architecture| Critical   | Deep review     | 2+ reviewers + architect | 48 hours |
| Security-related | Critical   | Security review | 2+ reviewers + security expert | 24 hours |

### Service Level Agreements (SLAs)

We aim for timely reviews to maintain development velocity:

| Team Size        | Priority   | Target First Response | Target Resolution |
| :--------------- | :--------- | :-------------------- | :---------------- |
| Small (3-7)      | Normal     | 4 business hours      | 1 business day    |
| Small (3-7)      | High       | 2 business hours      | 4 business hours  |
| Mid-sized (10-30)| Normal     | 8 business hours      | 2 business days   |
| Mid-sized (30+)  | High       | 4 business hours      | 1 business day    |
| Large (30+)      | Normal     | 24 business hours     | 3 business days   |
| Large (30+)      | High       | 8 business hours      | 1 business day    |

### Reviewer Roles

-   **Primary Reviewer:** Comprehensive code examination, functional requirements, test coverage, edge cases, timely feedback.
-   **Secondary Reviewer:** Architectural consistency, design patterns, performance, security, cross-functional requirements.
-   **Code Owner:** (If applicable via `CODEOWNERS`) Final approval authority for their domain.
-   **Expert Reviewer:** (e.g., Security, Performance, Accessibility) For specialized concerns.

### Checklists
