# Governance & Security: Enforcing Standards at Scale

## Introduction

As engineering organizations grow, maintaining security, compliance, and consistency across repositories becomes a critical challenge. This section outlines a comprehensive governance and security framework using GitHub's built-in features and best practices. It covers repository structure, branch protection, code ownership, and security policies to help you enforce standards at scale.

## Standardized Repository Structure

### Recommended Repository Layout

```
/
├── .github/                 # GitHub-specific configurations
│   ├── ISSUE_TEMPLATE/      # Issue templates
│   ├── workflows/           # GitHub Actions workflows
│   └── PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md
├── docs/                    # Documentation
├── src/                     # Source code
├── tests/                   # Tests
├── scripts/                 # Helper scripts
├── .gitignore
├── CHANGELOG.md
├── CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md
├── CONTRIBUTING.md
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
└── SECURITY.md
```

### Repository Templates

Create repository templates for different project types (e.g., service, library, website) to enforce this structure from the start.

## Branch Protection Rules

### Protecting Critical Branches

| Branch Pattern | Protection Rule | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `main` | Require PR, status checks, 2 approvals | Protect production code |
| `develop` | Require PR, status checks, 1 approval | Protect integration branch |
| `release/*` | Require PR, status checks | Protect release candidates |

### Enforcing Linear History

- **Best for**: Teams that prefer a clean, readable Git history.
- **How**: Enable "Require linear history" in branch protection.

### Requiring Signed Commits

- **Best for**: High-security projects or open-source.
- **How**: Enable "Require signed commits" to verify commit authorship.

## CODEOWNERS

### Basic CODEOWNERS File

```
# .github/CODEOWNERS

# Global owner
*       @global-owner

# Frontend code
/src/frontend/ @frontend-team

# Backend code
/src/backend/  @backend-team

# Documentation
/docs/        @docs-team
```

### Advanced CODEOWNERS Patterns

- **Multiple owners**: `/src/api/ @api-lead @security-expert`
- **Optional owners**: `^/src/optional/ @optional-team`
- **Per-file owners**: `package.json @dependency-manager`

## Security Policies and Procedures

### SECURITY.md

Your `SECURITY.md` file should include:
- **Supported versions**: Which versions of your project are currently supported with security updates.
- **Reporting a vulnerability**: A clear, private process for reporting vulnerabilities.
- **Security advisories**: Links to past security advisories.

### GitHub Security Advisories

- Use GitHub Security Advisories to privately discuss, fix, and publish information about security vulnerabilities.

### Dependabot

- **Version updates**: Automatically keep your dependencies up-to-date.
- **Security updates**: Automatically create PRs to fix vulnerable dependencies.

```yaml
# .github/dependabot.yml
version: 2
updates:
  - package-ecosystem: "npm"
    directory: "/"
    schedule:
      interval: "weekly"
```

## Compliance and Auditing

### Audit Logs

- Use GitHub's audit logs to review actions performed by users in your organization.

### Required Workflows

- For enterprise-level compliance, use required workflows to enforce specific CI/CD jobs across all repositories.

## Anti-Patterns and Warning Signs

- **Overly restrictive rules**: Branch protection that slows down development unnecessarily.
- **Stale CODEOWNERS**: The `CODEOWNERS` file is not kept up-to-date with team changes.
- **Ignoring Dependabot alerts**: Letting security vulnerabilities pile up.
- **Public vulnerability disclosure**: Reporting security issues in public channels.

## Expert Notes: Governance as an Enabler

> **Elite Team Insight**: Governance should be an enabler, not a blocker. The goal is to provide a secure, consistent foundation that empowers developers to ship code with confidence.

> **Scaling Tip**: As your organization grows, consider a tiered approach to governance. Allow more flexibility for experimental projects while enforcing stricter controls on production-critical repositories.

> **Security Note**: Automate as much of your security process as possible. Use Dependabot, CodeQL, and other tools to catch vulnerabilities early and often.

## Implementation Checklist

### Day 1 Setup
- [ ] Create a `SECURITY.md` file.
- [ ] Configure basic branch protection for `main`.
- [ ] Enable Dependabot for security updates.

### Small Team Evolution
- [ ] Create a `CODEOWNERS` file.
- [ ] Define repository templates.
- [ ] Implement stricter branch protection rules.

### Scaling to Mid-sized Teams
- [ ] Use required workflows for compliance.
- [ ] Implement a formal security advisory process.
- [ ] Conduct regular security audits.

### Large Organization Governance
- [ ] Establish a dedicated security team.
- [ ] Integrate with enterprise-level compliance tools.
- [ ] Implement automated governance-as-code solutions.
